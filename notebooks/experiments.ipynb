      "What is Cricket ?  \n",
      "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The game is played by 120 million players in more than 100 countries, making it the worldâ€™s second-most popular sport. It has a rich history, evolving over centuries from a rural pastime in England to a globally played sport. The basic objective of cricket is to score more runs than the opposing team. A run is scored when a batsman hits the ball and runs between the wickets. In addition to batting and running, a team can score runs by hitting the ball to the boundary, either on the ground or in the air, which results in four or six runs respectively.  \n",
      "Cricket is traditionally divided into three formats: Test cricket, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 (T20). Test cricket, which is the oldest format, is played over five days, while ODIs are played with 50 overs per side, and T20s have 20 overs per side. The game has evolved significantly with the advent of modern technologies like Hawk-Eye, and new formats like T20 leagues (e.g., Indian Premier League) have contributed to its growing global popularity.  \n",
      "The batting side tries to score runs while the bowling and fielding side works to dismiss the batsmen. A dismissal can occur in several ways, such as being bowled (the ball hits the stumps), caught (the ball is caught by a fielder or wicketkeeper before touching the ground), run out (the batsman is out of his ground when the stumps are broken), or stumped (a batsman is out of his ground while attempting to take a run). The bowler delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the batter at the other end, with the aim of getting the batter out.  \n",
      "The rules of cricket are codified in the Laws of Cricket, which are maintained by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in England. Cricket has produced legendary players like Sir Donald Bradman, Sachin Tendulkar, and Virat Kohli, who are regarded as some of the greatest to ever play the game. The sport has deep cultural significance in countries like India, Australia, England, and South Africa, where it is followed with great passion and enthusiasm.  \n",
      "International competitions such as the Cricket World Cup and the ICC T20 World Cup have helped further popularize the sport, while bilateral series between nations and domestic leagues continue to attract large audiences. Cricket has also made its mark in global sports culture with its unique mix of strategy, athleticism, and history.\n"
